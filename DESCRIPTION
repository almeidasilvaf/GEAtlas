Description: bears is an RNA-seq pipeline to create gene expression atlases 
    from publicly available RNA-seq data in NCBI's SRA. Users can download 
    raw reads, preprocess them, map to a reference genome and transcriptome, 
    and quantify the expression at the gene and transcript levels. 
    The goal of bears is to make RNA-seq data analysis pipelines reproducible, 
    with a framework built on state-of-the art methods and softwares, and 
    all of that in the comfort of an R session.
