Description: bear aims to download RNA-seq data from NCBI SRA,
    preprocess them, map to the reference genome, and quantify the expression
    at the gene level. The goal of bear is to make RNA-seq data analysis
    pipelines reproducible, with a framework built on state-of-the art methods
    and softwares.
